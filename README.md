This portfolio contains games that were made during my time as a student at Murdoch University.
These games were designed as a team, based on the scope given to us by our professors.
All games were made using Unity as per the scope given.
The games were designed with the intention of being played in VR, and therefore invoke more enjoyment by being played in VR.

The games include:
1) Minigolf Adventure
2) Order in Chaos

Minigolf Adventure
An immersive and entertaining VR minigolf game that allows players to experience the fun and challenge of minigolf in a virtual environment.
During the development of this game I was in charge of the level design.

Steps to download:
1) Navigate to the "Minigolf Adventure" folder.
2) Download either/both the Minigolf Adventure PC or/and Minigolf Adventure VR depending on which you wish to play.
3) Run the file named "Minigolf Adventure"

Order in Chaos
A captivating VR puzzle game that immerses you in chaotic environments, challenging your problem-solving skills and strategic thinking.
During the development of this game I was in charge of designing and developing the entire first level.
A criteria for this game was to be playable on the web without the need of any download.
As per the instructions of the professor each level should require a seperate link. Therefore only the first level is available as it is the only level I worked on.
